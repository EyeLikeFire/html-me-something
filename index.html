                <p>One day when I was painting I noticed that the 'ROYGBIV' color wheel has <b>7</b> colors and a full color wheel has <b>12</b> colors. 
                in music, each key has <b>7</b> notes, but there are <b>12</b> notes in an octave.
                I discovered that if you take the notes from a chord and pull together the corresponding colors you have a color pallet that makes aesthetic sense.
                <br>
                This started me down a path of exploration. I asked questions like "Is there any consistency to beauty or is it just in the eye of the beholder?". "Can formulas and algorithms be parsed from beauty or are the arts untouchable by math".
                The first distinction I realized I needed to make was separating the term 'Art' from the word 'beauty'. Art is expression and expression is whatever you chose it to be. Beauty is differnt in that it is measurably less debatable.
                <br>
                There are aspects of music we accept almost universally. We may have different  tastes in music, but if a guitar is out of tune it sounds 'ugly' regardless of the flavor of music.
                I theorize that the same is true for color. Different  cultures  gravitate towards different  triads and colors. The question isn't "what is the most beautiful <u>combination</u> of colors <b>but</b> what is the most beautiful <u>relationship</u> between colors.</p>

                <p>My research led me to Isaac Newton. He was the the creator of the 'ROYGBIV' color wheel. When I looked into it deeper I discovered that he believed there was correlation between music and color. He actually separated the colors in 'ROYGBIV' to correspond with music notes. This was both excited and discouraging to discover. I had accidentally stumbled on a theory shared by one of the most influential scientist in history 
                <b>but</b> he intentionally created the color wheel to correspond with music. That means that the correlation between color and music may have been created not discovered. 
                <br>Newton wasn't the only one with this theory though. In fact it's much older then Newton. Do you remember Pythagoras? In the context of philosophy you may remember that he influenced the likes of Plato and Aristotle. In the context of math then you may recognize his name from the Pythagorean theorem in geometry.<br>
                   Pythagoras had theories and beliefs regarding music and color. He believed that there was a mathematical harmony between the two (His theories of mathematical harmony expanded beyond just color and music and included our entire universe) Plato adopted some of these beliefs surrounding color and music as well.
                <br> Personally I don't know that there is a direct correlation between music and color, but I do belief that our understanding of color as far more primitive then our understanding of music. This makes sense really, our brains process sound almost 10X as fast as we do color. There is something too it, for music we have the circle of 5ths, applications of Fibonacci, and all kinds of mathematically applications. For color there is an undefined order, a code that is waiting to be discovered. </p>

                <p>What do you think? Is there an underling code beneath beauty that is waiting to be discovered?</p>                </p>
